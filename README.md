"Clicker" game where you produce bits by clicking/holding a button in order to use those bits for nefarious purposes. 

## Key Terms

- Outbound bits/sec: How many bits per second can you use for attacking.
- Inbound bits/sec: How many bits per second can you generate for storage.
- Stored bits: The number of bits created and stored in your storage unit.
- Storage Capacity: The total number of bits you can store in your storage unit.

## Core Concepts

- Create and store bits in a storage unit (Stored bits).
- Computers are required to transmit bits (Outbound bits/sec) to a target.
- Must have X Outbound bits/sec and Y Stored bits to attack a target, each increasing as you progress in targets.
- Can spend Stored bits on upgrades or use them for an attack.
- Attacking targets gives you access to better upgrade tiers.
- Must cooldown after generating bits (clicking button) for a brief delay. 

## Upgrades

Spend stored bits on upgrades to generate, store, and use more bits.

### System Upgrades

System upgrades can each be purchased one time, and replace the currently owned lower-tier version of the same system. For example, if you have a "Flip phone" and purcahse a "Desktop", the "Desktop" replaces the "Flip phone" and only higher level upgrades can then be purchased.

- Better Computers means more Outbound bits/sec.
	- Flip phone: 8 bps
	- Smartphone: 500 bps
	- Tablet: 1200 bps
	- Laptop: 40,000 bps
	- Desktop: 150,000 bps
	- Server: 8,000,000 bps
	- Server Farm: 650,000,000 bps
- Better storage units increase your Storage Capacity.
 	- Floppy drive: 400 bits
 	- CD: 20,000 bits
 	- USB Drive: 1,060,000 bits
 	- Hard drive: 800,000,000 bits
 	- FTP: 120,000,000,000 bits
 	- File Storage Saas: 480,000,000,000,000 bits
 	- Data Warehouse: 1,600,000,000,000,000 bits
 	- The Cloud: Infinite

### Repeatable Upgrades

Repeatable upgrades can be purchased a number of times (ex. 10x Keyboard, 5x Scripts, 15x Code Monkeys).

- Automation (increase Inbound bits/sec):
	- Keyboards: 1% increase
	- Scripts: 2% increase
	- Code Monkeys: 5% increase
	- Open Source Project: 10% increase
- Botnet (reduce Outbound bits/sec required to attack):
	- Workplace Botnet: 5% decrease
	- City-wide Botnet: 10% decrease
	- Regional Botnet: 15% decrease
	- Global Botnet: 20% decrease
- Network (increase Outbound bits/sec):
	- Dial-up: 1% increase
	- 2G: 2% increase
	- 3G: 3% increase
	- 4G: 4% increase
	- Hardline: 5% increase
- Compression (increase Storage Capacity):
	- Lossy Compression: 3% increase
	- Lossless Compression: 6% increase
	- ZIP: 9% increase
	- Machine Learning: 12% increase
- Data Replication (automatically generate Stored Bits):
	- Tape Backup: 0.1% Inbound bits/sec
	- Version Control: 0.2% Inbound bits/sec
	- 
	- 
	- 9 9s Availability: 0.5% Inbound bits/sec
